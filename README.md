- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wsdalex also known as William Alexander
  I am an ambitious software developer based in the London area. Having recently graduated Maker Academy, I am a strong programmer with a foundation in TDD and OOP. I am keen to embrace new technologies and always drive myself to learn more. My work experience has lead me to multiple industries including Film and Graphic Design. All of which have served me well when adapting to new roles. My goal is to grow as a developer and always deliver high quality work reliably.
